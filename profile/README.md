Indonesia is currently facing serious health sector challenges, particularly the rising prevalence of diabetes. According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) Diabetes Atlas, Indonesia ranks fifth globally, with 19.5 million diabetes cases in 2021, projected to increase to 28.6 million by 2045. This surge is driven by high sugar consumption, lack of physical activity, rising obesity, and elevated stress levels. The increase in diabetes significantly escalates healthcare costs and the risk of severe diseases such as heart attacks and strokes, threatening sufferers' quality of life and imposing a national health burden.

Additionally, a 2020 Euromonitor International survey revealed that only 30% of Indonesian consumers diligently read nutrition labels on food packaging, leaving 70% unaware of the nutritional composition of their purchases. Reading nutrition labels is a simple step to monitor sugar and calorie intake and prevent diabetes risks.

Inspired by the Singaporean government's Nutri-Grade labelling policy, which helps consumers choose healthier foods and beverages based on sugar and saturated fat content, our team developed the NutriFact Project. NutriFact leverages mobile technology and machine learning to translate complex nutrition labels into an easy "A" to "D" grade system. This allows consumers to assess the healthiness of products quickly through their phone screens. The project aims to enhance nutritional awareness, reduce disease risk, and promote healthy lifestyles within Indonesian society.
